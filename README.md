I currently have my bachelors in cybersecurity information assurance through, Western Governors University. For the past 3 years I have had a profound interest in IT/ cybersecurity and a dedication to continuing to learn and grow my skills to bring my value to a company's security posture and IT infrustructure.

## Objective

My love for technology has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to fully transition into this field, specifically aiming to someday work in a position of a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a junior Analyst.

## üìÅ Project Portfolio

> Each project below represents a practical challenge I set up and solved to build job-ready skills in real-world scenarios.

### üîß IT Infrastructure

- **[Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Active-Directory-Home-Lab)**  
  Standalone AD environment with DNS, DHCP, and automated user creation.

- **[Golden Image: IT + SOC Workstations](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Golden-Image-IT-and-SOC-Workstations)**  
  Hardened Windows 10 base images following security benchmarks.

- **[Active Directory Pt. 2](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/ActiveDirectory.Pt2)**  
  Nested OUs, role delegation, login scripts, custom GPOs.

- **[Home Network Segmentation Lab](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Network-Home-Lab)**  
  Network isolation using VLANs and inter-VLAN ACL blocking.
  
- **[Microsoft Entra ID + Intune Lab](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Microsoft-Entra-ID-Intune-Lab)**  
  Modern identity management: Entra ID tenant setup, user/group provisioning, conditional access policies, and device enrollment with Intune.

- **[Mobile Device Management (iOS with Intune)](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Mobile-Device-Management-with-IOS---Microsoft-Intune)**  
  Configured iOS device policies with Intune (password/PIN, app restrictions, data sharing controls) and published corporate apps via Company Portal.  

### üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Projects

- **[Zero Trust Access Control with Conditional Access](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Zero-Trust-Access-Control-with-Conditional-Access)**  
  Built Entra ID Conditional Access policies: blocked non-US logins, enforced MFA outside Trusted IPs, and validated Anonymous IP (Tor) logins flagged as risky before enabling policies in Active mode.

- **[iOS DLP with Intune App Protection](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/iOS-DLP-with-Intune-App-Protection)**  
  Enforced app-level DLP controls (PIN, encryption, copy/paste/save restrictions, screenshot blocking) on Outlook and OneDrive for iOS. Demonstrated secure BYOD data protection without requiring full device enrollment.

- **[Azure SIEM Project](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Azure-SIEM-Project)**  
  Detected real brute-force activity from honeypot logs via Azure Sentinel.

- **[OpenVAS Vulnerability Management](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/OpenVAS-Vulnerability-Management-Lab)**  
  Performed scans, interpreted CVEs, and wrote risk summaries.

- **[Wireshark PCAP Lab](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Wireshark-network-PCAP-analysis-Lab-VM)**  
  Identified malware patterns, DNS tunneling, and credential leaks.

- **[Active Directory SIEM Monitoring Lab](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/ActiveDirectory_SIEM_Monitoring)**  
  Simulated attacks monitored with splunk and sysmon

- **[Remote Wipe / Retire Simulation](https://github.com/AdrianFranc0/Incident-Response-Remote-Wipe-Retire-Simulation)**  
  Simulated incident response in Intune: issued **Retire** to remove corporate footprint from a BYOD-style device, then re-enrolled and executed **Wipe** to factory reset a Windows VM (lost/stolen laptop scenario). Verified completion via Intune Device Actions and endpoint reset to OOBE.
  
  ### üöÄ Upcoming Projects

- **Company Branding & Self-Service Portal**  
  Customize login screens, add company branding, and enable self-service password reset in Entra ID.

- **Defender for Endpoint Integration (Lite)**  
  Centralize Defender telemetry into Intune dashboards for basic endpoint security monitoring.
